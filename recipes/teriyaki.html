  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>Stuck in a salmon rut? We got you. You'll never believe how easy it is to make your own sweet-salty teriyaki sauce at home, and there's no better application for it than this beyond-simple weeknight favorite.</p>
  <p>It comes together faster than you can cook the rice!</p>

  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
  <li>½ cup sake</li>
  <li>¼ cup mirin</li>
  <li>¼ cup soy sauce</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
  <li>4 boneless salmon fillets</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Combine ½ cup sake, ¼ cup mirin, and ¼ cup soy sauce in a small bowl; set teriyaki sauce aside.</li>
  <li>Heat 1 Tbsp. oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Season 4 salmon fillets lightly with salt.</li>
  <li>Working in batches and adding more oil if needed, cook, skin side down, until skin is brown and crisp, about 4 minutes. Turn and cook until other side is just beginning to brown, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a plate.</li>
  <li>Pour off fat in skillet. Bring teriyaki sauce to a boil in skillet over medium heat. Cook until reduced by two-thirds, about 4 minutes.</li>
  <li>Add salmon, skin side up, and cook, spooning sauce over, until sauce is syrupy and salmon is just cooked through, about 2 minutes.</li>
  <li>Transfer to platter and serve with white rice, noodles, or a simple salad.</li>
</ol>
