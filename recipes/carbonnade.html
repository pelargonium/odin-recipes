  <h1>Carbonnade</h1>
  <img src="../images/carbonnade.jpeg" alt="recipes" height="300" width="300">
  <p>Unlike French beef stews made with wine, carbonnade relies on the deep, dark flavor of Belgian abbey-style beer. But what really gives carbonnade its distinctive character is the addition of brown sugar and a fillip of cider vinegar, a sweet-sour combination that plays beautifully against the caramelized onions and rich beer. </p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>

  <li>2 lb. beef chuck, cut into 2″ x 1/2″-thick slices</li>
